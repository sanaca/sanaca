1 - FakeRST
	Credit: Judy Novak
	Type: Client
	This evades IDS if the target system is a Linux Server
	In order to catch, the server must have the IDS policy set to Linux
	Default is BSD

	The ACK packet in the handshake has an increased ACK #
	which generates a RST from the server.  The client then
	proceeds to send the correct ACK which is accepted by
	the Linux server due to the nature of SYN-Cookies.
	If Snort is not set to a Linux based policy for stream
	reassembly, the IDS will drop the stream after observing
	the RST packet.
